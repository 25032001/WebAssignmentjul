        <p class="heading">Nikhil Chinapa</p>
        <p>
          To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his
          career, is like saying it snows in Alaska; a bit of an understatement.
          He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival Director
          —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital
          Design. A year later and for reasons that scientists are still trying
          to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be fun.” For
          once, he was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired.
          From MTV Select – MTV’s longest running show, (it aired continuously
          for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies as
          well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real
          job.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first
          love, music. In 2001, a conversation between friends resulted in the
          launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest Indian Electronic
          Dance Music (EDM) company in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well…
          whatever he feels like. His sets are moody, varied, often erratic but
          usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the
          random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music –
          the kind that has a repetitive monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at
          dangerous decibel levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival
          Curator and partner of Vh1 Supersonic, Goa’s brand new beach music
          festival.
